## Amazing Blog

This web application imitates a real blog web site that you'll see online along with some of the features that a production blog site will actually possess.
I made this to showcase my skills with modern technologies that are widely being used in the industry today. This is not a production application, it is just for practice.

### Features

<strong>Authentication</strong><br />
<strong>Role-based Authentication</strong> - I have three roles Super admin, author, and user. The Super admin has control over all posts and user accounts that are on the site. As a Super user you are also able to create a post, update your posts, delete your posts, and read all posts posted online. As an author you have CRUD functionality; you can create a post, update your posts, delete your posts, and read all posts posted online. As an user you are only allowed to read all posts.<br />
<strong>Administrator Dashboard</strong> - When you login as the super admin, your home screen will redirect you to the dashboard page where it shows all the user's account information along with the password hashed. You can add new users and delete current users (only the super user has access to this page).<br />
<strong>Text Editor</strong><br />
<strong>Edit Profile</strong><br />
